          The goal of this project was to build a function prototype for a
          drawing app with basic features such as drawing pre-build shapes and
          adding an eraser. One way we accomplished this was splitting the work
          between us so we could all be working on the project and then at the
          end, combine out project into one app. One challenge we faced was
          transferring user input into output such as determining where to draw
          predetermined shapes. One thing we learned was how to turn user input
          into an appropriate output on the app.

          The goal with this project was to build a functioning calculator that
          could, add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. I accomplished
          this mainly through coming up with an algorithm to preform any of the
          operations on two numbers in addition to allowing the user to type in
          the desired operations and the two numbers. One challenge for this
          project was diving the userâ€™s answer into different parts to be used
          throughout the program. One thing I learned was solutions can be a lot
          easier than what you initially think.

          The goal of this project was to create a slides presentation about the
          Holy Roman Empire. One way we accomplished this was splitting up the
          work between everyone while collaborating on the hardest parts such as
          the document analysis. One challenge we faced was making sure that
          everyone actually did there part of the presentation so it could be
          finished within the short deadline. One thing we learned was that when
          working in groups, who does what needs to be firmly established before
          actually going to make what you are making.
